    <p>This is an admittedly really simple piece of code that a surprising amount of people wanted to try out for themselves, and since I've already handed it to some I've decided to just go ahead and make a listing for it that I can point people towards in the future (I'm probably going to redesign my character profiles at some point anyways), </p>
    <p>You can copy the code in the "code" tab on the right.</p>
    <p>No credit's required when using this, it's honestly really simple. <br></p>
    <div style="padding:5px; background:rgba(0,0,0,0.35);"><strong>Heading<br></strong></div>
    <p>That up there is a heading, by the way. You can copy and paste those to make more.</p>
    <p>You'll need to disable WYSIWYG and edit the HTML to change the colors of everything, but you should be able to use it otherwise for changing the text (though it will make the html look messy next time you turn it off.)<br></p>
