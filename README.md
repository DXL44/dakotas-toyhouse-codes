Custom HTML and CSS for use on the character tracking website toyhouse

# What is this?

This is a repository to track all of the custom CSS and HTML I've written for use on [toyhou.se](https://toyhou.se), a character logging site. Everything in here is generally free to use on Toyhouse **only** so long as you don't remove the credit included.

# Okay, but this is already listed on your Toyhouse account. Why upload this to a Github repository? 
- It's easier for other people to copy and use. You have to jump through a few hoops to put raw HTML on a Toyhouse page, and I don't want to use a pastebin site to host it. CSS on the other hand usually doesn't have the source code visible at _all_ since on Toyhouse you just give someone an import statement to use.
- Issue tracking, PRs, branches, etc. 
- I want my work on these to be on my contrib graph lol this is webdev after all
